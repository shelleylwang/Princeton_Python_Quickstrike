# Princeton_Python_Quickstrike

Princeton University Python intensive. 10 weeks of Python skills: machine learning, Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, parallel processing, high performance computing, University cluster resources, deployment, regressions, etc. 

This project is the capstone of the course: it takes a Kaggle Spotify dataset of around 116,000 unique songs and their metadata, and performs various EDA, visualizations, and supervised and unsupervised learning models (trees, K-means clustering, etc.) on them.
